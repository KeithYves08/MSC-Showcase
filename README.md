# 🚀 MSC Showcase

**MSC Showcase** is an interactive hero section created for our organization’s website. Instead of a static banner, it invites users into a *space odyssey*-themed experience where they control an astronaut avatar and explore a galaxy map filled with digital projects.

## 🌌 Project Highlights

- 🧑‍🚀 **Avatar-Controlled Exploration**  
  Users click or tap to guide a space-suited avatar across an animated galaxy.

- 🪐 **10+ Interactive Digital Projects**  
  Each project (websites, games, apps, etc.) is represented by a unique planet or station. Reaching a destination opens a live demo in a new tab.

- 🎯 **QR Code Final Zone**  
  A final destination reveals a scannable QR code for registration or bonus interaction.

- 🧠 **Persistent Avatar Position**  
  User progress and avatar location persist via LocalStorage — no resets after exploring demos.

- 🎨 **Theming & Aesthetics**  
  - Microsoft color palette  
  - Space odyssey-inspired visuals  
  - Optional music and sound effects for immersion

- 💻 **Desktop-First Design**  
  Tailored for desktop use with basic mobile responsiveness.

- 🌐 **Static Site Hosting**  
  Deployable via GitHub Pages or any static web host.
