# 🚀 MSC Showcase

**MSC Showcase** is an interactive hero section built for our organization’s website. Rather than using a static hero banner, this project transforms the experience into a playable *space odyssey* where users control an astronaut avatar to explore our digital projects in a galaxy-themed environment.

## 🌌 Features

- 🎮 **Interactive Avatar Navigation**  
  Users click or tap to move a customizable astronaut avatar around a galaxy-like map.

- 🪐 **Over 10 Digital Projects**  
  Projects (games, websites, apps, etc.) are visually represented as planets or space stations. Reaching one lets users click to launch a live demo in a new tab.

- 🎯 **Persistent Avatar Position**  
  Avatar location remains unchanged even after opening project links — no respawning or reset.

- 🛰️ **Final QR Code Zone**  
  A special end area reveals a QR code for registration or additional interaction.

- 🎨 **Visual Theme**  
  - Space odyssey-inspired design  
  - Uses the Microsoft color palette  
  - Optional background music and SFX for immersion  

- 💻 **Desktop-First Design**  
  Optimized for desktop browsers, with basic mobile compatibility.

- 🌐 **Hosted as a Static Site**  
  Deploy-ready via GitHub Pages or any static hosting platform.
